GameTeX/README-sgs

sgsGameTex is a modification to the standard GameTeX version 1.3b.  The following changes are made:

1) Organization name is now settable in LaTeX/game.cls.  This file is now needed to compile the rules document.

2) The rules document has been pared down to remove MIT-specific references.

3) GameTeX can now take an external file to define the game path as long as the $TEXINPUTS is set correctly.  See game.cls for details.
