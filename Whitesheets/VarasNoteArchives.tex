Something strange is going on here. For the last couple of days, something has been playing tricks on my memory. I cannot afford to give up now though, so I have decided to start recording my actions to counteract this difficulty.

In my ongoing quest to steal the King's scepter, I have puzzled for some time over how to break into the throne room. After some investigation, I have learned from the nobles that ``baskets worth of rubies are required to gain access to the King'', or whatever that means.

In any case, it looks like I'm going to need to steal some rubies first. After rifling through the stacks, I think that I have managed to determine the locations some of the rubies in this palace. In addition to the one at the guard station just outside (which of course is only accessible when everyone is accounted for at their stations), there seem to be others in the barracks, the vault, and the kitchen of all places.

Looks like I have my work cut out for me.
