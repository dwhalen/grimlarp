Something strange is happening below. The guards seem to be losing their wits. I am even starting to have trouble holding on. So much for the scepter, I should just grab some gold from the treasury and escape. The guardian is blinded, so it shouldn't be too difficult. I know there must be something behind that weakened section of wall, if only there were a way to get to it.
